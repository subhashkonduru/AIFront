# AI-Powered Intelligent Code Optimization Suite

This project aims to create a scalable AI-powered code optimization suite that automates debugging, refactoring, performance tuning, and security auditing using multi-agent workflows.

## Technologies Used:
- **FastAPI**: Backend API for code analysis and optimization.
- **React.js**: Interactive frontend for code input and optimization insights.
- **Trae AI IDE**: For building and managing multi-agent workflows.
- **Novita.ai**: APIs for code analysis, bug detection, and optimization suggestions.
- **Zilliz**: Vector database for storing and retrieving optimized code snippets.

## Project Structure:

```
.qodo/
backend/
  main.py
  requirements.txt
frontend/
  public/
    index.html
  src/
    App.js
    index.js
README.md
```

## Setup and Installation:

### Backend (FastAPI)
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the FastAPI application:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

### Frontend (React.js)
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if not already installed by `create-react-app`):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Features to be Implemented:
- **Agent System Integration**: Define AI agents within Trae AI IDE for code review, security, and performance.
- **Novita.ai Integration**: Call Novita.ai APIs for static analysis, refactoring, and security compliance.
- **Zilliz Integration**: Embed and semantically search optimized code snippets.
- **Performance Dashboard**: Visualize optimization results, benchmarking, and security findings in the frontend.
